# Ray Tracer Discovery

This project is to learn a bit about ray tracing but ultimately will focus on discovering/learning ways to increase performance of the code. I will be following this project for the basics of the code: [Ray Tracing In One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html#overview)

After that I will be using tools such as [Google Benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark) and [Compiler Explorer](https://godbolt.org) to identify areas where I can improve the performance of the code. My initial PRs will just be code following the book, but will then evolve into more detailed explanations of things I find / improve upon.
