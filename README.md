# Ray Tracer Discovery

This project is to learn a bit about ray tracing but ultimately will focus on discovering/learning ways to increase performance of the code. I will be following this project for the basics of the code: [Ray Tracing In One Weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html#overview)

After that I will measure the code and look for areas to improve performance (execution time, memory usage, etc). This is mainly to learn about different profiling tools / optimization techniques.
